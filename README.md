Project Name : Community Crafter

<strong>Summary</strong> : The app prioritizes the sense of community. Communities can effortlessly post class requirements, and tutors can seamlessly connect with these opportunities, fostering collaboration and enriching educational experiences. Community Heads can create and post requirements on behalf of their entire community and Tutors can search for community requirements available within any set radius from their place of residence and send proposals. The community Head can then visit the tutors profile and then confirm the tutor for their future service using the app. The tutors can then head to these communities and deliver teaching sessions as per the requirement posted from the community. These community requirements could be any kind of learning experience ranging from academics to sports to dance or even music.
